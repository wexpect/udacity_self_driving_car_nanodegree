Polynomial Trajectory Generation

If you are interested in learning more about PTG, I've included a link to a paper (below) titled "Optimal Trajectory Generation for Dynamic Street Scenarios in a Frenet Frame". It is short and discusses some interesting (and potentially useful) topics like:

Cost Functions.
Differences between high speed and low speed trajectory generation.
Implementation of specific maneuvers relevant to highway driving like following, merging, and velocity keeping.
How to combining lateral and longitudinal trajectories.
A derivation of the transformation from Frenet coordinates to global coordinates (in the appendix).
